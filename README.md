# STM32 Complete Project


In this project, I established a connection between STM32 and computer by Serial Connection protocol, in the same time I used  C# to write a desktop program that can receive massages which it will be sent by STM32, by that desktop program I can send some command to STM32 and want from him to make it.

I wrote STM32 codes by C and C++ in the Keil program. and wrote the desktop program by C# in the Visual Studio program.

▪ To access STM32 code open this file: STM32-Complete-Project/project/MDK-ARM/prorject.uvprojx  (you must open it by Keil program)
▪To access serial port program's code you have to use Visual Studio



This the equipments i have used: 
▪ STM32F103C8 
▪ AT24C256 EEPROM 
▪ MPU6050 
▪ TTL USB 
▪ Potansiyometre
